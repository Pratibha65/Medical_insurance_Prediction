# Medical_insurance_Prediction

•This project involves developing a Linear Regression model to predict insurance charges based on various features such as age, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. 
•The dataset was preprocessed by encoding categorical variables and splitting into training and testing sets. 
•The model achieved R² scores of approximately 66% on both training and testing data, indicating a moderate ability to explain the variance in insurance charges. 
•The project demonstrates how to apply regression techniques and python to real-world data for cost prediction.
